Sorting Algorithms Overview
This project involves implementing and analyzing several sorting algorithms in C, focusing on their time complexities, stability, and suitability for different inputs.

Project Goals
Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
Understand Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
Determine the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
Understand and implement a stable sorting algorithm.
Implemented Sorting Algorithms
The project involves the implementation of the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Quick Sort
Understanding Time Complexity
For each algorithm, we will analyze the best, average, and worst-case time complexities and represent them using Big O notation.

Choosing the Right Algorithm
Based on the analysis, we aim to determine the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given type of input, considering factors like input size and initial order.

Stable Sorting Algorithm
A stable sorting algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements. In our implementations, we strive for stability where applicable.

Task Overview
The tasks involve implementing and analyzing each sorting algorithm, providing the time complexity analysis in Big O notation, and ensuring correctness and efficiency.

Bubble Sort: Sort an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Insertion Sort: Sort a doubly-linked list using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
Selection Sort: Sort an array using the Selection Sort algorithm.
Quick Sort: Sort an array using the Quick Sort algorithm.
... and so on for each task, describing the sorting algorithm, its purpose, and the expected output.
